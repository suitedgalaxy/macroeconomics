			<p>
				The production possibilities curve shows the trade-offs in the ways an economy can allocate its resources. It graphically demonstrates scarcity <br>
				trade-offs, opportunity costs, and efficiency. Any point along the curve represents a possible combination that can be produced given a certain <br>
				productivity or efficiency. The curve is not fixed â€” an increase in efficiency or productivity will shift the curve outward and vice versa.
