	<h1>Units 1 & 2: Economic Indicators & The Business Cycle</h1>
		<p>All countries have three macroeconomic goals:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Promote economic growth</li>
			<li>Limit unemployment</li>
			<li>Limit inflation</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The Circular Flow Model</h2>

			<p>
				<u>Factor Payments</u>- payment for the factors of production: rent, wages, interest, and profit. <br>
				<u>Transfer Payments</u>- the government redistributes income (e.g. welfare, social security). <br>
				<u>Subsidies</u>- government payments to businesses.
			</p>

		<h2>The Production Possibilities Curve and The Business Cycle</h2>

			<p>
				The production possibilities curve shows the trade-offs in the ways an economy can allocate its resources. It graphically demonstrates scarcity, <br>
				trade-offs, opportunity costs, and efficiency. Any point along the curve represents a possible combination that can be produced given a certain <br>
				productivity or efficiency. The curve is not fixed — an increase in efficiency or productivity will shift the curve outward and vice versa.
			</p>
	
		<h2>Unemployment</h2>
			<p>
				<u>Unemployment</u>- workers that are <i>actively looking for a job</i> but aren't working. <br>
				<u>The Unemployment Rate</u>- the percentage of people in the labor force who want a job but are not working.
			</p>
			<img src="unemployment rate.svg">
			<br> <b>Three Types of Unemployment</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Frictional Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Temporary unemployment or being between jobs. Individuals are qualified workers with transferable skills. <br>
					<u>Seasonal Unemployment</u> is a specific type of frictional unemployment, which is due to time of year and the nature of the job.
				</span></ul>
				<br>

				<li>Structural Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Changes in the labor force makes some skills obsolete. These workers <b>do not</b> have transferable skills and these jobs will <br>
					never come back. Workers must learn new skills to get a job. The permanent loss of these jobs is called "<u>creative destruction</u>." <br>
					<u>Technological Unemployment</u> is a type of structural unemployment where automation and machinery replace workers.
				</span></ul>
				<br>
				<li>Cyclical Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Unemployment caused by a recession. This is sometimes called "demand deficient unemployment."
				</span></ul>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Frictional and structural unemployment are present at all times because some people will always be between jobs or replaced by technology. <br>
				The <b>Natural Rate of Unemployment</b> is frictional unemployment plus structural unemployment. This is the amount of unemployment when <br>
				the economy is healthy and growing. We calculate GDP at <b>Full Employment Output</b>, or at the natural rate of unenployment — which excludes <br>
				cyclical unemployment — and label it <i>Y</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Criticisms of the Unemployment Rate</b> <br>
				<u>Discouraged Workers</u>- some people are no longer looking for a job because they have given up (they no longer count in the labor force thus <br>
				the unemployment rate falls). <br>
				<u>Underemployed Workers</u>- someone who wants more hours but can't get them is still considered employed. <br>
				<u>Inequalities</u>- the overall unemployment rate doesn't show disparity for minorities and teenagers.
			</p>

		<h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h2>
			<p>
				GDP is the dollar value of all <u><i>final</i></u> goods and services produced within a country in one year. <i>Final</i> means that GDP <br>
				only counts <i>new</i> goods and services.
			</p>
			<h3>Measuring Growth</h3>
				<img src="percent change in gdp.svg">
			<h3>Measuring Standard of Living</h3>
				<p>
					<b>GDP Per Capita</b> is GDP divided by the population. It identifies on average how many products each person makes. GDP per capita is the <br>
					best measure of a nation's standard of living.
				</p>
			<h3>GDP Exclusions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Intermediate Goods</li>
					<ul><span>
						Goods inside final goods don't count. The price of a finished car is included in GDP, not the stock radio or tires.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Nonproduction Transactions</li>
					<ul><span>
						Financial Transactions (e.g. stocks, bonds, real estate) <br>
						Used Goods (e.g. old cars, used clothes)
					</span></ul>
					<li>Nonmarket and Illegal Activities</li>
					<ul><span>
						Things made at home — <u>household production</u> <br>
						(e.g. unpaid work, black markets, drugs)
					</span></ul>
				</ol>
			<h3>Calculating GDP</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><u>Expenditures Approach</u>- sum of all the spending on final goods and services produced.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Consumer Spending — <i>C</i></li>
						<li>Business Investment — <i>I</i></li>
						<li>Government Spending — <i>G</i></li>
						<li>Net Exports- Exports — <i>X</i> — minus Imports — <i>M</i></li>
					</ol>
					<li>Income Approach- sum of all income earned from selling all final goods and services produced.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Labor Income- wages earned from performing work.</li>
						<li>Rental Income- income earned from property owned by individuals.</li>
						<li>Interest Income- interest earned from loaning money to businesses.</li>
						<li>Profit Income- money businesses have after paying all of their costs.</li>
						<p><u>Factor Payments</u></p>
					</ol>
					<li>Value-added Approach- sum of dollar value added at each stage of the production process.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Each approach should generate the same number.</p>
