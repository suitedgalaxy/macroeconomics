	<h1>Units 1 & 2: Economic Indicators & The Business Cycle</h1>
		<p>All countries have three macroeconomic goals:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Promote economic growth</li>
			<li>Limit unemployment</li>
			<li>Limit inflation</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The Circular Flow Model</h2>
			<img src="/the circular flow model.png"> <!-- CFM found in [2.1-2.2 Macro Economic Indicators] -->
			<p>
				<u>Factor Payments</u>- payment for the factors of production: rent, wages, interest, and profit. <br>
				<u>Transfer Payments</u>- the government redistributes income (e.g. welfare, social security). <br>
				<u>Subsidies</u>- government payments to businesses.
			</p>

		<h2>The Production Possibilities Curve and The Business Cycle</h2>
			<img src="ppc.png" width="500">
			<img src="business cycle.png" width="500">
			<p>
				The production possibilities curve shows the trade-offs in the ways an economy can allocate its resources. It graphically demonstrates scarcity,
				trade-offs, opportunity costs, and efficiency. Any point along the curve represents a possible combination that can be produced given a certain
				productivity or efficiency. The curve is not fixed — an increase in efficiency or productivity will shift the curve outward and vice versa.
			</p>
	
		<h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h2>
			<p>
				GDP is the dollar value of all <b><i>final</i></b> goods and services produced within a country in one year. <i>Final</i> means that GDP
				only counts <i>new</i> goods and services.
			</p>
			<h3>Measuring Growth</h3>
				<img src="percent change in gdp.svg">
			<h3>Measuring Standard of Living</h3>
				<p>
					<b>GDP Per Capita</b> is GDP divided by the population. It identifies on average how many products each person makes. GDP per capita is the
					best measure of a nation's standard of living.
				</p>
			<h3>GDP Exclusions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Intermediate Goods</li>
					<ul><span>
						Goods inside final goods don't count. The price of a finished car is included in GDP, not the stock radio or tires.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Nonproduction Transactions</li>
					<ul><span>
						Financial Transactions (e.g. stocks, bonds, real estate) <br>
						Used Goods (e.g. old cars, used clothes)
					</span></ul>
					<li>Nonmarket and Illegal Activities</li>
					<ul><span>
						Things made at home — <u>household production</u> <br>
						(e.g. unpaid work, black markets, drugs)
					</span></ul>
				</ol>
			<h3>Calculating GDP</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><u>Expenditures Approach</u></li>
					<ul><span>
						The sum of all the spending on final goods and services produced. This is the sum of consumer spending <i>C</i>, business investment <i>I</i>,
						government spending <i>G</i>, and net exports — exports <i>X</i> minus imports <i>M</i>.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Income Approach</li>
					<ul><span>
						The sum of all income earned from selling all final goods and services produced — <u>Factor Payments</u>. This is the sum of labor,
						rental, interest, and profit income, earned from performing work, property owned by individuals, loaning money to businesses,
						and money businesses have after paying all of their costs, respectively.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Value-added Approach</li>
					<ul><span>The sum of the dollar value added at each stage of the production process.</span></ul>
				</ol>
				<p>Each approach should generate the same number.</p>
			<h3>The Components of GDP</h3>
				<img src="components of gdp.svg"> <br>
				<h4>Consumer Spending — <i>C</i></h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Durable Goods- (e.g. washing machines, refrigerators, cars)</li>
						<li>Non-Durable Goods- (e.g. food, clothes, toilet paper)</li>
						<li>Services- (e.g. dental work, repairs, tutoring)</li>
					</ol>
				<h4>Business Investment — <i>I</i></h4>
					<p>
						The word "investment" is used differently in economics. Investment is <i>never</i> when individuals buy assets like stocks and bonds.
						Investment is <i>always</i> when businesses buy capital like machines, resources, and tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						Does the purchase of a new oven produced in America count as consumer spending or investment spending? <b>It depends.</b>
						It is consumer spending if the oven is purchased for a home and investment spending if the oven is purchased by a business.
					</p>
				<h4>Government Spending — <i>G</i></h4>
					<p>
						Government expenditures tracks the spending made in the "public sector." This includes payments made by the government for goods and services.
						It does not include money spent on transfer payments. It does not include interest payments on the national debt.
					</p>

		<h2>Unemployment</h2>
			<p>
				<u>Unemployment</u>- workers that are <i>actively looking for a job</i> but aren't working. <br>
				<u>The Unemployment Rate</u>- the percentage of people in the labor force who want a job but are not working.
			</p>
			<img src="unemployment rate.svg"> <br>
			<b>Three Types of Unemployment</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Frictional Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Temporary unemployment or being between jobs. Individuals are qualified workers with transferable skills. <br>
					<u>Seasonal Unemployment</u> is a specific type of frictional unemployment, which is due to time of year and the nature of the job.
				</span></ul>
				<br>

				<li>Structural Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Changes in the labor force makes some skills obsolete. These workers <b>do not</b> have transferable skills and these jobs will
					never come back. Workers must learn new skills to get a job. The permanent loss of these jobs is called "<u>creative destruction</u>."
					<u>Technological Unemployment</u> is a type of structural unemployment where automation and machinery replace workers.
				</span></ul>
				<br>
				<li>Cyclical Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Unemployment caused by a recession. This is sometimes called "demand deficient unemployment."
				</span></ul>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Frictional and structural unemployment are present at all times because some people will always be between jobs or replaced by technology.
				The <u><b>Natural Rate of Unemployment</b></u> is frictional unemployment plus structural unemployment. This is the amount of unemployment when
				the economy is healthy and growing. We calculate GDP at <u><b>Full Employment Output</b></u>, or at the natural rate of unenployment — which excludes
				cyclical unemployment.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Criticisms of the Unemployment Rate</b> <br>
				<u>Discouraged Workers</u>- some people are no longer looking for a job because they have given up (they no longer count in the labor force thus
				the unemployment rate falls). <br>
				<u>Underemployed Workers</u>- someone who wants more hours but can't get them is still considered employed. <br>
				<u>Inequalities</u>- the overall unemployment rate doesn't show disparity for minorities and teenagers.
			</p>

		<h2>Inflation</h2>
			<p>
				Inflation is the rising of the general level of prices and the reduction of the "purchasing power" of money. When inflation occurs, each dollar will
				buy fewer goods than before. In general, high inflation is bad because banks don't lend and people don't save. This decreases investment and GDP.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Deflation</u> is the decrease in general prices or a negative inflation rate. Deflation is bad because people will hoard money and assets. This decreases
				investment and GDP. <u>Disinflation</u> is the decrease of inflation — prices increasing at slower rates. The target number for inflation is <b>2%</b>.
			</p>
			<h3>The Effects of Unanticipated Inflation</h3>
				<p>
					<i>Lenders</i> — people who lend money (at fixed interest rates) — and people with fixed incomes and savers are <b>hurt by inflation</b>. <br>
					<i>Borrowers</i> — people who borrow money (at fixed interest rates) — are <b>helped by inflation</b>. <br>
					<u>Nominal Wage</u>- wage measured by dollars (rather than purchasing power). <br>
					<u>Real Wage</u>- wage adjusted for inflation.
				</p>
			<h3>The Cost of Inflation</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Menu Costs</li>
					<ul><span>
						There is a cost of changing listed prices. Businesses must update menus, signage, advertising, etc.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Shoe Leather Costs</li>
					<ul><span>
						There is an increased cost of transactions. People reduce their real money holdings so they must spend time and effort making additional
						trips to the bank.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Unit of Account Costs</li>
					<ul><span>
						The currency is no longer reliable as a way of measuring value. This leads to less efficient use of resources because of uncertainty caused
						by changes in currency value. It makes money less reliable as a unit of measurement.
					</span></ul>
				</ol>
			<h3>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h3>
				<p>
					The most commonly used measurement of inflation for consumers is the consumer price index. <b>The base year is given an index of 100</b>. 50 represents a halving in prices.
					200 represents a doubling in prices. The quantity of items in the basket must be the same as the base year.
				</p>
				<img src="consumer price index.svg"> <br>
				<h4>Problems of the CPI</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Substitution Bias</li>
						<ul><span>
							Consumers buy less of the products in the market basket as it gets more expensive and more substitutes that may not be
							in the market basket. CPI may be higher than consumers are really paying.
						</span></ul>
						<li>New Products</li>
						<ul><span>
							The CPI market basket may not include the newest consumer products. CPI measures prices but not the increase in choices.
						</span></ul>
						<li>Product Quality</li>
						<ul><span>
							The CPI ignores improvements and decline in product quality. CPI may suggest prices stay the same though economic well-being
							has changed signifigantly.
						</span></ul>
					</ol>
			<h3>The Three Causes of Inflation</h3>
<!-- 				[2.4 Inflation] the quantity theory of money -->
				<ol>
					<li>Printing Too Much Money (The Quantity Theory of Money)</li>
					<li>Demand-Pull Inflation</li>
					<ul><span>
						"Too many dollars chasing too few goods." An overheated economy with excessive spending but the same amount of goods; demand pulls
						up prices.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Cost-Push Inflation</li>
					<ul><span>
						Higher production costs increase prices. A <u>negative supply shock</u> increases the cost of production and forces producers to
						increase prices; <b>The price of a key resource increases</b>.
					</span></ul>
				</ol>
			<h3>Real versus Nominal</h3>
				<img src="real nominal inflation.svg"> <br>
				<p>
					<b><u>Nominal GDP</u></b> is GDP in current prices and does not account for inflation. <b><u>Real GDP</u></b> is GDP adjusted for inflation; it is expressed in dollars with
					fixed purchasing power. Real GDP "deflates" nominal GDP by adjusting for inflation in terms of a base year's prices.
				</p>
			<h3>GDP Deflator</h3>
				<p>
					<b>The base year is given an index of 100</b>. Values lower than 100 represent deflation. Value greater than 100 represent inflation.
				</p>

	<h1>Unit 3: National Income & Price Determination</h1>
		<h2>Aggregate Demand, Short-Run Aggregate Supply, and Long-Run Aggregate Supply</h2>
			<p>
				Aggregate demand is the amount of goods and services (real GDP) that consumers are willing to buy at different price levels. Aggregate demand has an inverse relationship
				between price level and real GDP. Aggregate supply is the amount of goods and services (real GDP) that firms will produce at different price levels. Aggregate supply is
				divided into the short-run and the long-run because wages and resource prices are sticky and will not change in the short-run but are flexible and will change in the
				long-run.
			</p>
			<p>
				Changes in consumer spending, investment spending, government spending, or net exports — changes in GDP — shift aggregate demand. Changes in resource prices, actions
				of the government, and productivity shift short-run aggregate supply. The shifters of long-run aggregate supply are the same as the production possibilities curve.
			</p>
<!-- 			<img src="aggregate demand and aggregate supply model.png" width="500"> -->
			<img src="as ad lras.jpeg" width="500">
			<h3>Output Gaps</h3>
<!-- 					need images -->
				<p>
					Inflationary Gap (Positive Output Gap). Recessionary Gap (Negative Output Gap). <b>Stagflation</b> is a recessionary gap where there is inflation and a
					stagnate economy.
				</p>
				
		<h2>The Multiplier Effect</h2>
			<p>
				An initial change in spending will set of a spending chain that is magnified in the economy. The amount AD increases by a chnage in spending depends on how much of the new income
				consumers save. If they save a lot, AD will increase less than if they spent a lot. <u>Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)</u> and <u>Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)</u> are 
				normalized values that represent how much people save and consume. <b>They always add to one.</b> The <u>spending multipler</u> is equal to the reciprocal of the MPS. The total
				change in GDP equals the spending multiplier times the intial change in spending. The <b>tax multipler</b> shows what happens when the government cuts (or increases) taxes.
				<b>It is one less than the spending multiplier.</b>
			</p>
		<h2>Fiscal Policy</h2>
			<p>Fiscal policy are actions by Congress to stabilize the economy.</p>
			<p>
				<u>Discretionary Fiscal Policy</u>- Congress creates a new bill that is designed to change AD through government spending or taxation. One problem is lag times due to bureaucracy.
				It takes time for congress to act. <i>Example: In a recession, Congress increases spending.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Non-Discretionary Fiscal Policy (Automatic Stabilizers)</u>- Permanent spending or taxation laws enacted to work counter cyclically to stabilize the economy. When GDP goes down,
				government spending automatically increases. <i>Examples: Welfare, Unemployment, income tax.</i>
			</p>
			<p><u>Contractionary Fiscal Policy</u>- Laws that reduce inflation, decrease GDP (close an inflationary gap). Decrease Government Spending. Increase Taxes (decreasing disposable income).</p>
			<p><u>Inflationary Fiscal Policy</u>- Laws that reduce unemployment and increase GDP (close a recessionary gap). Increase Government Spending. Decrease Taxes (increasing disposable income).</p>
			<h3>Lag Times</h3>
				<p>Fiscal policy often has three lag times</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Recognition Lag- congress must react to economic indicators before it’s too late.</li>
					<li>Administrative Lag- congress takes time to pass legislation.</li>
					<li>Operational Lag- spending/planning takes time to execute.</li>
				</ol>
	<h1>Unit 4: The Financial Sector</h1>
		<h2>What is Money</h2>
			<p>
				<u>The Barter System</u>- goods and services are traded directly. There is no money exchanged. Before trade occurred, each trader had to have something the other had; this is called
				the “<u>Double Coincidence of Wants.</u>” Some goods can’t be split
			</p><p>
				Money is anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services. Money is not the same as wealth or income. <u>Commodity Money</u>- something that performs the
				function of money and has intrinsic value. <u>Fiat Money</u>- something that serves as money but has no other value or uses
			</p>
			<p>
				Money has three functions. It is a <u>Medium of Exchange</u> — money can easily be used to buy goods and services with no complications of
				a barter system. It is a <u>Unit of Account</u> (Measure of Value) — money measures the value of all goods and services. It is a <u>Store
				of Value</u> — money allows people to store purchasing power for the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to be effective, money must be generally accepted, scarce, portable, and dividable. That is, buyers and sellers must have confidence
				it is legal tender, it must not be easily reproduced, and it must be easily transported and divided.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <u>purchasing power</u> of money is the amount of goods and services a unit of money can buy.
			</p>
		<h2>Liquidity and Interest Earning Assets</h2>
			<p>
				<u>Liquidity</u> is the ease with which an asset can be converted into <i>raw money</i> (e.g. cash). In general, higher-interest earning assets have lower liquidity.
				The money supply is divided into different categories based on the liquidity of the asset. The highest liquidity is M1 money, including currency in circulation,
				checkable bank deposits (checking accounts), and traveler's checks. M2 money is near-money, including savings deposits (money market accounts),
				time deposits (certificate of deposits), and money market funds.
			</p>
		<h2>Banking</h2>
			<p>
				<u>Fractional Reserve Banking</u> is a system where banks hold a portion of deposits to cover potential withdrawals and loan out the rest. The percentage of deposits
				banks are required to carry is called the <u>The Reserve Ratio</u> or <u>The Reserve Requirement</u>. <i>One bank's loan becomes another bank's deposit</i>, which in
				essence creates money or "multiplies" money. The <u>Money Multiplier</u> is equal to the reciprocal of the reserve requirement. Initially money is not multiplied because
				it has to be loaned out first before the multiplier effect occurs.
			</p>
		<h2>Money Demand and Supply</h2>
			<p>
				People demand a certain amount of liquid assets (money) for two different reasons: the <u>Transactional Demand for Money</u> — people hold money for everyday transactions —
				and the <u>Asset Demand for Money</u> — people hold money because it is less risky than other assets. People also demand interest earning assets. When the interest rate falls,
				people would have less incentive convert cash into interest earning assets and thus the demand for money increases. When interest rates rise, people would prefer to
				have interest earning assets instead and thus the demand for money decreases. <b>There is an inverse relationship between interest rate and the quantity of money demanded.</b>
				The demand for money is shifted by changes in price level, income, and technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S. money supply is set by the central bank, The Federal Reserve. <u>Monetary Policy</u> are actions by the central bank to stabilize the economy. The money supply is
				shifted by the reserve requirement, the discount rate, and open market operations. The <u>Discount Rate</u> is the interest rate The Federal Reserve charges banks for a loan.
				<b>Lower interest rates lead to higher investment</b>. <u>Open Market Operations</u> is when the Federal Reserve buys or sells government bonds. If the Federal Reveserve buys
				government bonds, they will increase the money supply and vice versa. The <u>Federal Funds Rate</u> is the interest rate banks charge one another for one-days loans of reserves.
				Although the Federal Reserve cannot simply tell banks what to charge each other, the federal funds rate fluctuates due to market conditions and is heavily influcenced by monetary
				policy.
			</p>
			<img src="supply of money.jpeg" width="500">
		<h2>The Loanable Funds Market</h2>
			<p>
				Lenders would rather give loans at extremely high interest rates but borrowers would rather take loans at extremely low interest rates. Saving is what makes lending
				possible so the amount of loanable funds available is the amount of money that is saved. <u>Private Saving</u> is the amount households save instead of consume.
				<u>Public Saving</u> is the amount the government saves instead of spends. <u>National Savings</u> is private saving and public saving combined.
