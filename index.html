	<h1>Units 1 & 2: Economic Indicators & The Business Cycle</h1>
		<p>All countries have three macroeconomic goals:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Promote economic growth</li>
			<li>Limit unemployment</li>
			<li>Limit inflation</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The Circular Flow Model</h2>
			<img src="/the circular flow model.png"> <!-- CFM found in [2.1-2.2 Macro Economic Indicators] -->
			<p>
				<u>Factor Payments</u>- payment for the factors of production: rent, wages, interest, and profit. <br>
				<u>Transfer Payments</u>- the government redistributes income (e.g. welfare, social security). <br>
				<u>Subsidies</u>- government payments to businesses.
			</p>

		<h2>The Production Possibilities Curve and The Business Cycle</h2>

			<img src="business cycle.png" width="500">
			<p>
				The production possibilities curve shows the trade-offs in the ways an economy can allocate its resources. It graphically demonstrates scarcity,
				trade-offs, opportunity costs, and efficiency. Any point along the curve represents a possible combination that can be produced given a certain
				productivity or efficiency. The curve is not fixed — an increase in efficiency or productivity will shift the curve outward and vice versa.
			</p>
	
		<h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h2>
			<p>
				GDP is the dollar value of all <u><i>final</i></u> goods and services produced within a country in one year. <i>Final</i> means that GDP
				only counts <i>new</i> goods and services.
			</p>
			<h3>Measuring Growth</h3>
				<img src="percent change in gdp.svg">
			<h3>Measuring Standard of Living</h3>
				<p>
					<b>GDP Per Capita</b> is GDP divided by the population. It identifies on average how many products each person makes. GDP per capita is the
					best measure of a nation's standard of living.
				</p>
			<h3>GDP Exclusions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Intermediate Goods</li>
					<ul><span>
						Goods inside final goods don't count. The price of a finished car is included in GDP, not the stock radio or tires.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Nonproduction Transactions</li>
					<ul><span>
						Financial Transactions (e.g. stocks, bonds, real estate) <br>
						Used Goods (e.g. old cars, used clothes)
					</span></ul>
					<li>Nonmarket and Illegal Activities</li>
					<ul><span>
						Things made at home — <u>household production</u> <br>
						(e.g. unpaid work, black markets, drugs)
					</span></ul>
				</ol>
			<h3>Calculating GDP</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><u>Expenditures Approach</u></li>
					<ul><span>
						The sum of all the spending on final goods and services produced. This is the sum of consumer spending <i>(C)</i>, business investment <i>(I)</i>,
						government spending <i>(G)</i>, and net exports — exports minus imports, or <i>X</i> minus <i>M</i>.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Income Approach</li>
					<ul><span>
						The sum of all income earned from selling all final goods and services produced — <u>Factor Payments</u>. This is the sum of labor,
						rental, interest, and profit income, earned from performing work, property owned by individuals, loaning money to businesses,
						and money businesses have after paying all of their costs, respectively.
					</span></ul>
					<li>Value-added Approach</li>
					<ul><span>The sum of the dollar value added at each stage of the production process.</span></ul>
				</ol>
				<p>Each approach should generate the same number.</p>
			<h3>The Components of GDP</h3>
				<img src="components of gdp.svg"> <br>
				<h4>Consumer Spending — <i>C</i></h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Durable Goods- (e.g. washing machines, refrigerators, cars)</li>
						<li>Non-Durable Goods- (e.g. food, clothes, toilet paper)</li>
						<li>Services- (e.g. dental work, repairs, tutoring)</li>
					</ol>
				<h4>Business Investment — <i>I</i></h4>
					<p>
						The word "investment" is used differently in economics. Investment is <i>never</i> when individuals buy assets like stocks and bonds.
						Investment is <i>always</i> when businesses buy capital like machines, resources, and tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						Does the purchase of a new oven produced in America count as consumer spending or investment spending? <b>It depends.</b>
						It is consumer spending if the oven is purchased for a home and investment spending if the oven is purchased by a business.
					</p>
					<!-- 	Inventories [2.1-2.2 Macro Economic Indicators] -->
				<h4>Government Spending — <i>G</i></h4>
					<p>
						Government expenditures tracks the spending made in the "public sector." This includes payments made by the government for goods and services.
						It does not include money spent on transfer payments. It does not include interest payments on the national debt.
					</p>

		<h2>Unemployment</h2>
			<p>
				<u>Unemployment</u>- workers that are <i>actively looking for a job</i> but aren't working. <br>
				<u>The Unemployment Rate</u>- the percentage of people in the labor force who want a job but are not working.
			</p>
			<img src="unemployment rate.svg"> <br>
			<b>Three Types of Unemployment</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Frictional Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Temporary unemployment or being between jobs. Individuals are qualified workers with transferable skills. <br>
					<u>Seasonal Unemployment</u> is a specific type of frictional unemployment, which is due to time of year and the nature of the job.
				</span></ul>
				<br>

				<li>Structural Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Changes in the labor force makes some skills obsolete. These workers <b>do not</b> have transferable skills and these jobs will
					never come back. Workers must learn new skills to get a job. The permanent loss of these jobs is called "<u>creative destruction</u>."
					<u>Technological Unemployment</u> is a type of structural unemployment where automation and machinery replace workers.
				</span></ul>
				<br>
				<li>Cyclical Unemployment</li>
				<ul><span>
					Unemployment caused by a recession. This is sometimes called "demand deficient unemployment."
				</span></ul>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Frictional and structural unemployment are present at all times because some people will always be between jobs or replaced by technology.
				The <b>Natural Rate of Unemployment</b> is frictional unemployment plus structural unemployment. This is the amount of unemployment when
				the economy is healthy and growing. We calculate GDP at <b>Full Employment Output</b>, or at the natural rate of unenployment — which excludes
				cyclical unemployment — and label it <i>Y</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Criticisms of the Unemployment Rate</b> <br>
				<u>Discouraged Workers</u>- some people are no longer looking for a job because they have given up (they no longer count in the labor force thus
				the unemployment rate falls). <br>
				<u>Underemployed Workers</u>- someone who wants more hours but can't get them is still considered employed. <br>
				<u>Inequalities</u>- the overall unemployment rate doesn't show disparity for minorities and teenagers.
			</p>

		<h2>Inflation</h2>
			<p>
				Inflation is the rising of the general level of prices and the reduction of the "purchasing power" of money. When inflation occurs, each dollar will
				buy fewer goods than before. In general, high inflation is bad because banks don't lend and people don't save. This decreases investment and GDP.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>Deflation</u> is the decrease in general prices or a negative inflation rate. Deflation is bad because people will hoard money and assets. This decreases
				investment and GDP. <u>Disinflation</u> is the decrease of inflation — prices increasing at slower rates. The target number for inflation is <b>2%</b>.
			</p>
			<h3>The Effects of Unanticipated Inflation</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Lenders</b> — people who lend money (at fixed interest rates) — and people with fixed incomes and savers are <i>hurt by inflation</i>. <br>
					<b>Borrowers</b> — people who borrow money (at fixed interest rates) — are <i>helped by inflation</i>. <br>
					<u>Nominal Wage</u>- wage measured by dollars (rather than purchasing power). <br>
					<u>Real Wage</u>- wage adjusted for inflation.
				</p>
